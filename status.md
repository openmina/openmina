## Experimental State Machine Architecture

### Core state machine

- [x] Automaton implementation that separates *action* kinds in *pure* and *effectful*
- [x] Callback (dispatch-back) support for action composition: enable us to specify in the action itself the actions that will dispatched next
- [x] Fully serializable state machine state and actions (including descriptors to callbacks!)
- State machine state management
  - [x] Partitioning of the state machine state between models sub-states (for *pure* models)
  - [x] Forbid direct access to state machine state in *effectful* models
  - [x] Support for running multiple instances concurrently in the same state machine for testing scenarios: for example, if the state machine represents a node, we can "run" multiple of them inside the same state machine

### Models

Each model handles a subset of actions and they are registered like a plugin system

#### Effectful

A thin layer of abstraction between the "external world" (IO) and the state machine

- [x] MIO model: provides the abstraction layer for the polling and TCP APIs of the MIO crate
- [x] Time model: provides the abstraction layer for `SystemTime::now()`

#### Pure

Handle state transitions and can dispatch actions to other models.

- [x] Time model: this is the *pure* counterpart which dispatches an action to *effectful* time model to get the system time and updates the internal time in the state machine state
- [x] TCP model: built on top of the MIO layer to provide all necessary features for handling TCP connections (it also uses the time model to provide timeout support for all actions)
- [x] TCP-client model: built on top of the TCP model, provides a high-level interface for building client applications
- [x] TCP-server model: built on top of the TCP model, provides a high-level interface for building server applications
- [x] PRNG model: unsafe, fast, pure RNG for testing purposes
- PNET models: implements the private network transport used in libp2p.
   - [x] Server
   - [x] Client
 - Testing models:
   - [x] Echo client: connects to an echo server and sends random data, then checks that it receives the same data
   - [x] Echo server
   - [x] Echo client (PNET)
   - [x] Echo server (PNET)
   - [x] Simple PNET client: connects to berkeleynet and does a simple multistream negotiation

### Tests

- Echo network
  - [x] State machine with a network composed of 1 client and 1 server instance.
  - [x] State machine with a network composed of 5 clients and 1  erver instance.
  - [x] State machine with a network composed of 50 clients and 1  erver instance.
- [x] Echo network PNET (same tests as echo network, but over the PNET transport).
- [x] Berkeley PNET test: runs the simple PNET client model.
