# P2P Services

The native Mina node, written in OCaml, supports P2P communication over the LibP2P protocol. Weâ€™ve developed LibP2P support for the Rust node to be compatible with OCaml nodes. 

The Web Node is written in Rust code that is compiled into WebAssembly (wasm). The Web Node cannot make direct use of TCP sockets, and for that reason, it is impossible to use LibP2P. However, since WebRTC sockets are exposed, we can instead use those for P2P communication.


## webrtc_with_libp2p 
Implements WebRTC and libp2p services for the native node.

When `P2pServiceWebrtcWithLibp2p::init` is called it will initialize the `webrtc::P2pServiceCtx` and `Libp2pService` services, returning a `P2pServiceCtx` instance.  

```
pub struct P2pServiceCtx {
    pub webrtc: super::webrtc::P2pServiceCtx,
    pub libp2p: Libp2pService,
}
```

## WebRTC service
The WebRTC service main-loop task, which receives *state machine* commands (`Cmd` type) from an MPSC channel.

```
pub enum Cmd {
    PeerAdd(PeerAddArgs),
}

pub struct PeerAddArgs {
    peer_id: PeerId,
    kind: PeerConnectionKind,
    event_sender: mpsc::UnboundedSender<P2pEvent>,
    cmd_receiver: mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<PeerCmd>,
}

pub enum PeerConnectionKind {
    Outgoing,
    Incoming(webrtc::Offer),
}
```

The only kind of command handled by the service's main-loop is `Cmd::PeerAdd`. For each received command, the main loop spawns a new task to handle the command (`peer_start` async function).

There are two cases that are handled: [outgoing connections](#outgoing-connections) and [incoming connections](#incoming-connections).

### Outgoing connections
The steps for handling an outgoing connection are the following:

- Create an RTC connection using the default `RTCConfigIceServers` (one belonging to Openmina, and Google ones).
- Create the main channel for the new RTC connection.
- Create an `offer` and pass it to the `set_local_description` API of the WebRTC implementation.
- Wait for the Ice gathering state to be `RTCIceGatheringState::Complete`.
- Get SDP and send a `P2pConnectionEvent::OfferSdpReady(peer_id, Ok(sdp))` message to the *state machine*.
    - If an error occurs in any of the previous states, an `P2pConnectionEvent::OfferSdpReady(peer_id, Err(..))` is sent instead.
- Receive a `PeerCmd` from the *state machine*:
    ```
    pub enum PeerCmd {
        PeerHttpOfferSend(String, webrtc::Offer),
        AnswerSet(webrtc::Answer),
        ChannelOpen(ChannelId),
        ChannelSend(MsgId, ChannelMsg),
    }
    ```
    If the received command is `PeerCmd::PeerHttpOfferSend(url, offer)`, the service will signal an RTC `offer` (of `Offer` type) by sending an HTTP request to the specified `url`. 

    ```
    pub struct Offer {
        pub sdp: String,
        /// Offerer's identity public key.
        pub identity_pub_key: PublicKey,
        /// Peer id that the offerer wants to connect to.
        pub target_peer_id: PeerId,
        // TODO(binier): remove host and get ip from ice candidates instead
        /// Hostname or IP of the signaling server of the offerer.
        pub host: Host,
        /// Port of the signaling server of the offerer.
        pub listen_port: u16,
    }
    ```
    Then the service receives the HTTP response and turns it into a `P2pConnectionEvent::AnswerReceived(peer_id, answer)` and delivers it to the *state machine*.

    Finally, the service should receive a `PeerCmd::AnswerSet` message from the *state machine*.

- Call the `set_remote_description` API of the WebRTC implementation with the `answer` received during the signaling process, and sends a `P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized` message to the *state machine*.

- Check the WebRTC connection state:
    - If the state is `RTCConnectionState::Connected` a `P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized(peer_id, Ok(()))` is sent to the *state machine*.
    - Otherwise, an error/disconnection happened. If the connection was closed a `P2pConnectionEvent::Closed` message is sent to the *state machine*. If an error occurs, a `P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized(pper_id, Err(err))` is sent.

- Enter the [peer loop](#peer-loop)

### Incoming connections
The steps for handling an incoming connection are the following:

- Create an RTC connection using the default `RTCConfigIceServers` (one belonging to Openmina, and Google ones).
- Create the main channel for the new RTC connection.
- Call the `set_remote_description` API of the WebRTC implementation passing it the `offer` received from the *state machine* message (`PeerConnectionKind::Incoming(offer)`).
- Create an `answer` and pass it to the `set_local_description` API of the WebRTC implementation.
- Wait for the Ice gathering state to be `RTCIceGatheringState::Complete`.
- Get SDP and send a `P2pConnectionEvent::AnswerSdpReady(peer_id, Ok(sdp))` message to the *state machine*.
    - If an error occurs in any of the previous states, an `P2pConnectionEvent::AnswerSdpReady(peer_id, Err(..))` is sent instead.
- Check the WebRTC connection state:
    - If the state is `RTCConnectionState::Connected` a `P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized(peer_id, Ok(()))` is sent to the *state machine*.
    - Otherwise, an error/disconnection happened. If the connection was closed a `P2pConnectionEvent::Closed` message is sent to the *state machine*. If an error occurs a `P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized(pper_id, Err(err))` is sent.

- Enter the [peer loop](#peer-loop)

### Peer loop
First, a MPSC channel is created for "internal" messages, the channel will be used by the function itself and also by callbacks. Then we enter the main loop of the function that receives two kinds of messages:

- "External" commands: coming from the *state machine*. These are of the `PeerCmd` type described earlier.
- "Internal" commands: sent by the peer-loop itself. These are of the following `PeerCmdInternal` type.
    ```
    enum PeerCmdInternal {
        ChannelOpened(ChannelId, Result<RTCChannel, Error>),
        ChannelClosed(ChannelId),
    }

    enum PeerCmdAll {
        External(PeerCmd),
        Internal(PeerCmdInternal),
    }
    ```

The following commands (internal and external) are handled by the loop:
- `PeerCmdAll::External(PeerCmd::ChannelOpen(id))`

    Spawns a new task that
        - Creates an RTC channel using the `id` provided by the command.
        - Registers callbacks for error and disconnection events on the channel, if called these will send a `PeerCmdInternal::ChannelClosed(id)`.
        - Sends a `PeerCmdInternal::ChannelOpened` message containing the `id` and the newly created channel (or an error if any of the previous steps failed).

- `PeerCmdAll::External(PeerCmd::ChannelSend(msg_id, msg))`

    Sends a `msg` of `ChannelMsg` type to the peer over an RTC channel.
    ```
    pub enum ChannelMsg {
        BestTipPropagation(BestTipPropagationChannelMsg),
        SnarkPropagation(SnarkPropagationChannelMsg),
        SnarkJobCommitmentPropagation(SnarkJobCommitmentPropagationChannelMsg),
        Rpc(RpcChannelMsg),
    }
    ```
    These variants represent the messages supported by the MINA P2P protocol. These messages are sent to a task that is associated to the channel, which binprot serializes the messages and send over the WebRTC transport taking care of handling chunking.
    On any error a `P2pChannelEvent::Sent` message with the error code is sent to the *state machine*.

- `PeerCmdAll::Internal(PeerCmdInternal::ChannelOpened(chan_id, result))`

    - Includes the new channel into the channels list.
    - Spawns the task associated to the channel that takes care of receiving the `ChannelMsg`s, encode them and send them over the WebRTC transport. Every time a message is sent the task reports it to the *state machine* by sending a `P2pChannelEvent::Sent` message.
    - Sets a callback on the channel for when messages are received over the WebRTC transport. This callback deserializes the messages (taking care of chunking) and sends them to the *state machine* with a `P2pChannelEvent::Received` message.
    - Reports back the result of the operation to the *state machine* with a `P2pChannelEvent::Opened` message.

- `PeerCmdAll::Internal(PeerCmdInternal::ChannelClosed(id))`

    Removes the channel from the channels list and sends a `P2pChannelEvent::Closed` to the *state machine*.


## Libp2pService
Uses the *libp2p* crate to implement P2P communication over a transport stack composed of: **TCP -> PNet -> Noise -> Yamux**.

Over this transport the following RPCs are implemented:
- `AnswerSyncLedgerQueryV2`
- `GetAncestryV2`
- `GetBestTipV2`
- `GetStagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtHashV2`
- `GetTransitionChainProofV1ForV2`
- `GetTransitionChainV2`

The service's main-loop task (using *Tokio*) handles [events](#event-handling-handle_event) coming from *libp2p*, and [commands](#command-handling-handle_cmd) coming from the *state machine*.

### Event handling (handle_event)
Events come from *libp2p* in `SwarmEvent` form and are translated into messages (of `P2pEvent` type) that are sent to the *state machine* over a *MPSC* channel.

| Incoming SwarmEvent | Resulting P2pEvent |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `SwarmEvent::NewListenAddr` | none |
| `SwarmEvent::ListenerError` | none |
| `SwarmEvent::ListenerClosed` | none |
| `SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished` | `P2pEvent::Connection(P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized(..))` |
| `SwarmEvent::ConnectionClosed` | `P2pEvent::Connection(P2pConnectionEvent::Closed(..))` |
| `SwarmEvent::OutgoingConnectionError` | `P2pEvent::Connection(P2pConnectionEvent::Finalized(..))` |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Gossipsub(GossipsubEvent::Message{.. message}))` | See [GossipsubEvent](#GossipsubEvent) |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Rpc((peer_id, RpcBehaviourEvent::ConnectionClosed)))` | none (TODO?) |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Rpc((peer_id, RpcBehaviourEvent::ConnectionEstablished)))` | none (TODO?) |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Rpc((peer_id, RpcBehaviourEvent::Stream{Received::Menu(_), stream_id})))` | none |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Rpc((peer_id, RpcBehaviourEvent::Stream{Received::HandshakeDone, stream_id})))` | `P2pEvent::Channel(P2pChannelEvent::Received(peer_id, Ok(ChannelMsg::Rpc(P2pChannelEvent::Opened(..)))))` |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Rpc((peer_id, RpcBehaviourEvent::Stream{Received::Query{ header: QueryHeader { tag ..} ..}, stream_id})))` | See [Request](#Request) |
| `SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::Rpc((peer_id, RpcBehaviourEvent::Stream{Received::Response{header: ResponseHeader {id ..} ..}, stream_id})))` | See [Response](#Response) |

| Incoming libp2p events (other) | Resulting P2pEvent |
|-------------------|-----------------|               
| `BehaviourEvent::Identify(..)` | `P2pEvent::Libp2pIdentify(..)` |


#### GossipsubEvent
| Incoming binprot message | Outgoing P2pEvent |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `GossipNetMessage::NewState(block)` | `P2pEvent::Channel(P2pChannelEvent::Received(.., ChannelMsg::BestTipPropagation(..))` |
| `GossipNetMessage::SnarkPoolDiff{..}` | `P2pEvent::Channel(P2pChannelEvent::Libp2pSnarkReceived(..))` |

#### Request
The outgoing message has the form `P2pEvent::Channel(P2pChannelEvent::Received(peer_id, Ok(ChannelMsg::Rpc(RpcChannelMsg::Request(.., request)))))`, where `request` depends on the `tag` value of the `QueryHeader` of the received query.

| Input tag | request value |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `GetBestTipV2` | `P2pRpcRequest::BestTipWithProof` |
| `GetAncestryV2` | `P2pRpcRequest::BestTipWithProof` |
| `AnswerSyncLedgerQueryV2` | `P2pRpcRequest::LedgerQuery(..)` |
| `GetStagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtHashV2` | `P2pRpcRequest::StagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtBlock(..)` | 
| `GetTransitionChainV2` | multiple `P2pRpcRequest::Block(..)` messages for each hash |
| `GetTransitionChainProofV1ForV2` | sends empty response over libp2p without state machine interaction |
| `GetSomeInitialPeersV1ForV2` | `P2pRpcRequest::InitialPeers` |

#### Response
The libp2p `NetworkBehaviour` implementation used by the *Libp2pService* contains extra state (`ongoing` field) to map a `(peer, msg_id)` pair to a `(tag, version)` pair.

```
#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]
#[behaviour(out_event = "Event")]
pub struct Behaviour<E: 'static + From<P2pEvent>> {
    pub gossipsub: gossipsub::Behaviour,
    pub rpc: RpcBehaviour,
    pub identify: identify::Behaviour,
    #[behaviour(ignore)]
    pub event_source_sender: mpsc::UnboundedSender<E>,
    // TODO(vlad9486): move maps inside `RpcBehaviour`
    // map msg_id into (tag, version)
    #[behaviour(ignore)]
    pub ongoing: BTreeMap<(PeerId, u32), (String, i32)>,
    // map from (peer, msg_id) into (stream_id, tag, version)
    //
    #[behaviour(ignore)]
    pub ongoing_incoming: BTreeMap<(PeerId, u32), (StreamId, String, i32)>,
}
```

The outgoing message has the form `P2pEvent::Channel(P2pChannelEvent::Received(peer_id, Ok(ChannelMsg::Rpc(RpcChannelMsg::Response(.., response)))))`, where `response` depends on a `tag` value obtained from from the `outgoing` map. The `peer_id` and `msg_id` (`id` from `ResponseHeader`) from the incoming message are used to find the `tag` value in this map.

| tag | response value |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `GetBestTipV2` | `P2pRpcResponse::BestTipWithProof` |
| `AnswerSyncLedgerQueryV2` | `P2pRpcResponse::LedgerQuery` |
| `GetStagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtHashV2` | `P2pRpcResponse::StagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtBlock` |
| `GetTransitionChainV2` | multiple `P2pRpcResponse::Block(..)` messages for each hash |
| `GetSomeInitialPeersV1ForV2` | `P2pRpcResponse::InitialPeers(..)` |


### Command handling (handle_cmd)
The *state machine* can send over MPSC the following commands to the *Libp2pService*:
```
pub enum Cmd {
    Dial(DialOpts),
    Disconnect(PeerId),
    SendMessage(PeerId, ChannelMsg),
    SnarkBroadcast(Snark, u32),
}
```

These are handled by the `Libp2pservice::handle_cmd` (async) function which will usually perform some swarm action(s).

| Incoming Cmd | Libp2pService action(s) |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| `Cmd::Dial(maddr)` |  `swam.dial(addr)` |
| `Cmd::Disconnect(peer_id)` | `swarm.disconnect_peer_id(peer_id)` |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, ChannelMsg::SnarkPropagation(..))` | none (unsupported) |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, ChannelMsg::SnarkJobCommitmentPropagation(..))` | none (unsupported) |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, ChannelMsg::BestTipPropagation(BestTipPropagationChannelMsg::GetNext))` | none (TODO?) |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, ChannelMsg::BestTipPropagation(BestTipPropagationChannelMsg::BestTip(block)))` | `Self::gossipsub_send(swarm, &GossipNetMessage::NewState(block))` |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, ChannelMsg::Rpc(RpcChannelMsg::Request(id, request)))` | See [RPC requests](#rpc-requests) |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, ChannelMsg::Rpc(RpcChannelMsg::Response(id, response)))` | See [RPC responses](#rpc-response) |
| `Cmd::SendMessage(peer_id, Cmd::SnarkBroadcast(snark, nonce))` | `Self::gossipsub_send(swarm, &GossipNetMessage::SnarkPoolDiff { NetworkPoolSnarkPoolDiffVersionedStableV2::AddSolvedWork(...), nonce })` |



#### RPC requests
RPC requests are handled based on the their `P2pRpcRequest` variant, which contains the request information from the point of view of the *state machine*. These are converted by the *Libp2pService* into the wire form used by the MINA protocol (binprot encoded) and the resulting binary blob is embedded into the `bytes` field of `Command::Send`.

```
pub enum Command {
    Send { stream_id: StreamId, bytes: Vec<u8> },
    Open { outgoing_stream_id: u32 },
}
```

The `Command` type abstracts the transport-specific details away, so only the `peer_id` and `stream_id` (yamux provides multiplexing) are needed to deliver the binprot encoded messages over a libp2p connection.

The MINA P2P messages that can be binprot encoded are of the `Message<T>` type. The RPC requests in particular are of type `Query<T>`.
```
pub enum Message<T> {
    Heartbeat,
    Query(Query<T>),
    Response(Response<T>),
}
```

Summing up: we receive from the *state machine* a `P2pRpcRequest` variant, based on the variant the *Libp2pService* builds a `Query<T>` message that gets binprot serialized and delivers the correct peer/stream over the libp2p transport.

| Request variant | `Query<T>` |
|-----------------|---|
| `P2pRpcRequest::BestTipWithProof` | `Query<GetBestTipV2>` |
| `P2pRpcRequest::LedgerQuery(..)` | `Query<AnswerSyncLedgetQueryV2>` |
| `P2pRpcRequest::StagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtBlock(..)` | `Query<GetStagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtHashV2>` |
| `P2pRpcRequest::Block(..)` | `Query<GetTransitionChainV2>` |
| `P2pRpcRequest::Snark(..)` | none |
| `P2pRpcRequest::InitialPeers` | `Query<GetSomeInitialPeersV1ForV2>` |


#### RPC response
Based on the `Cmd::SendMessage`s `peer_id` and stream `id` information, the *Libp2pService* can find in the `ongoing_incoming` map of the [Behavior](#response) which is the RPC request that we are responding to. 

The way the RPC response is constructed and delivered over libp2p is almost identical to RPC queries, but this time we build the `Response` variant of the `Message<T>`.

| `Response<T>` (from previous request) | response data (input / state machine) | response data (output / libp2p) |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Response<GetBestTipV2>` | none | none |
| `Response<GetBestTipV2>` | `P2pRpcResponse::BestTipWithProof(msg)` | `ProofCarryingDataStableV1{..}` |
| `Response<GetAncestryV2>` | none | none |
| `Response<GetAncestryV2>` | `P2pRpcResponse::BestTipWithProof(msg)` | `ProofCarryingDataWithHashV1{..}` |
| `Response<AnswerSyncLedgerQueryV2>` | none | none |
| `Response<AnswerSyncLedgerQueryV2>` | `P2pRpcResponse::LedgerQuery(msg)` | `MinaLedgerSyncLedgerAnswerStableV2` |
| `Response<GetStagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtHashV2>` | none | none |
| `Response<GetStagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtHashV2>` | `P2pRpcResponse::StagedLedgerAuxAndPendingCoinbasesAtBlock(msg)` | `(msg.scan_state, msg.staged_ledger_hash, msg.pending_coinbase, msg.needed_blocks)` |
| `Response<GetTransitionChainV2>` | none | none |
| `Response<GetTransitionChainV2>` | `P2pRpcResponse::Block(msg)` | `vec![MinaBlockBlockStableV2{..}]` |
| `Response<GetSomeInitialPeersV1ForV2>` | none | none |
| `Response<GetSomeInitialPeersV1ForV2>` | `P2pRpcResponse::InitialPeers(peers)` | `vec![NetworkPeerPeerStableV1{..}]` |
|  | `P2pRpcResponse::Snark(..)` | none |
