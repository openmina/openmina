### P2p Testing Framework

This is a lighter version of the [Testing Framework](../../node/testing/) that
is focused on peer-to-peer functionality of the Rust node.

It allows to set up, run and observe clusters of peers that implement Mina p2p
protocols. Such peers are Rust-node based and `rust-libp2p` based (to have reference implementations).

Running and observing a test cluster is done by reading it as a `Stream`, emitting different events as its components progress.
