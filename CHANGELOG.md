All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.0] - 2025-04-04

### Added

- **GraphQL**: More queries (snark pool, pending snark work, genesis block, ledger status).

### Changed

- **GraphQL**: Added more fields to `daemonStatus` queryË™

### Fixed

- **GraphQL**: Some issues with accounts.
- **Block Producer**: Corner case that caused the won slot search to sometimes be interrupted at epoch bounds.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-03-13

### Added

- Restored support for snark workers.
- **Archive**: Support for storing blocks to AWS, GCP and filesystem.
- **Tooling**: WebRTC traffic sniffer.
- **GraphQL**:
  - `sendPayment` mutation.
  - `sendDelegation` mutation.
  - `pooledUserCommands` query.
  - `pooledZkappCommands` query.
  - Various other partially implemented queries expanded to ensure compatibility with the OCaml node.


### Changed

- **P2P**: Wait until full validation is complete before broadcasting transactions and completed works.
- **Transition frontier**: Perform cheap consensus operation first, and then the more expensive proof verification.
- **Transaction pool**: Unified libp2p and webrtc logic for the initial phase of handling transactions received from gossip network. As a result, processing of transactions received during bootstrap is delayed until the initial sync is complete.
- **Transaction pool**: Suspend processing during block production.

### Fixed

- **Transition frontier**: Rare race condition in the case of forks during block production that could result in dropping staged ledgers too early.
- **Webnode**: Replaced tokio channels which had a race condition that could crash the thread on WASM.
- **Transaction pool**: Verify zkApp proofs in a dedicated thread to avoid blocking the state machine.

## [0.14.0] - 2025-01-31

### Changed

- **Rust Toolchain**: Updated the minimum required Rust toolchain to version 1.84.
- **Proofs**: Optimizations (MSM, field inversion) that speed up proof production.

### Fixed

- **P2P**: Correct handling of yamux windows limits
- **P2P**: Wait until full validation is complete before broadcasting blocks.
- **WebRTC/P2P**: Handle propagation of messages received from the WebRTC network to libp2p's gossip network (blocks, snarks and transactions).
- **Transaction pool**: Fixed checks for deep account updates when pre-validating transactions.

### Added

- **Archive mode**: Added support for archive mode, which allows the node to connect to an archiver process and store node data in a database.

## [0.13.0] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- **Mempool**: Inside the transaction and snark pool reducers, only broadcast locally injected transactions and producer snarks. Libp2p layer takes care of diffs received from gossip already.
- **P2P**: Don't forget the initial peers list.
- WebRTC connection leaks.
- zkApp transaction proofs are now verified on a separate thread.
- Sometimes produced blocks were broadcasted too early.
- `OneOrTwo::zip` never panics now, on failure it returns an error.

### Changed

- On native, use jemalloc as the default allocator.
- Allocations reduced considerably by using stack-allocated bignums in the VRF evaluator.
- The same thread is now reused to verify all block proofs.
- `RUST_BACKTRACE` is always set to `full` now.

- **P2P**: More efficient memory usage when managing the p2p state.
- **P2P**: Lower outgoing traffic by being more conservative about what is broadcasted to each peer.
- **P2P**: Better handling of disconnections.
- **VRF**: Correctly handle cases in which the delegator table is empty.
- **Webnode**: Peer connection handling improvements.

### Changed

- **Webnode**: Reduced startup time by loading prover indexes in parallel to the bootstrap process.

- **Webnode**: Connection authentication.

### Fixed

- **Ledger**: Fixed a regression introduced in v0.10.0 that caused the ZKApp precondition checks ordering to not match the OCaml implementation's exactly, which resulted in block application failures.
- **Ledger**: Corrected handling of custom tokens in the block application logic.
- **P2P**: Reduced excessive outgoing traffic.
